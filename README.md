# Project Title

This project uses **Google Custom Search API** to search for products and services online. It integrates an easy way to fetch results from Google Search programmatically.

## 📋 **Setup Instructions**

To use the Google Custom Search API in your project, follow these steps:

### 1. **Create Google API Key**

   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Enable the **Custom Search API** for the project.
   - Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**, and create a **New API Key**. This key will authenticate your requests to the API.

### 2. **Create a Custom Search Engine (CSE)**

   - Visit [Google Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/).
   - Create a new search engine, specifying your search parameters (like websites you want to include in the search results or allow it to search the entire web).
   - After creating the engine, you'll receive a **Search Engine ID**.

### 3. **Making API Requests**

Once you have your **API Key** and **Search Engine ID**, use them to send requests to the API.

**Example Request URL:**
```plaintext
https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?q=your+search+term&key=YOUR_API_KEY&cx=YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID
